### Implementation of GA for approximation of noisy data by 3rd order polynomial function.

(c) Juraj Kardos, 2014

Noisy data are generated by given polynomial function defined in file generator.c and adding small noise. Data are located in file input.txt. Format of file is couple x and f'(x) on each line, where f'(x) is noisy polynomial function we want to approximate.

Usage: `$./generator N`, where N is number of generated data points.

Fitness is squared sum of difference between approximation function g(x) and noisy data points. The lower fitness is the better approximation was found. Fitness = sum for 1..N(sqr(g(x\_i)-f'(x\_i)))

Exact solution, i.e. generating polynomial function f(x) without noise has these parameters:

```
$ cat solution.txt 
c0 = -5;
c1 = 3;
c2 = 4;
c3 = -2;
```

This repository consists of three different impmlementations:
1. CPU serial code
2. GPU accelerated code
3. MPI code using multiple GPUs
    a. Whole population is cloned to all GPUs, problem is solved without any
       communication during computation. At the end, each process sends
       it solution to master, who select the best one.
    b. Population is distributed across processes. During each time step
       population is scattered, mutation and evaluation of fitness is done
       locally on each process and afterwards population is gathered on master,
       where selection and crossover is performed.

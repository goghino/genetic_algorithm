### Implementation of GA for approximation of noisy data by 3rd order polynomial function.

(c) Juraj Kardos, 2014

Noisy data are generated by given polynomial function defined in file generator.c and adding small noise. Data are located in file input.txt. Format of file is couple x and f'(x) on each line, where f'(x) is noisy polynomial function we want to approximate.

Usage: `$./generator N`, where N is number of generated data points.

Fitness is squared sum of difference between approximation function g(x) and noisy data points. The lower fitness is the better approximation was found. Fitness = sum for 1..N(sqr(g(x\_i)-f'(x\_i)))

Exact solution, i.e. generating polynomial function f(x) without noise has these parameters:

```
$ cat solution.txt 
c0 = -5;
c1 = 3;
c2 = 4;
c3 = -2;
```

This repository consists of three different impmlementations:

1. CPU serial code
2. GPU accelerated code
3. MPI code using multiple GPUs
